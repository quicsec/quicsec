# QuickStart


QuicSec functions as middleware for your application. The steps involved in adoption quicsec are:

- [Porting](https://quicsec.io/docs/porting) your application to use QuicSec, typically with the one line change illustrated in the [Porting](/docs/porting) guide.

- Optionally, [Configuring](https://quicsec.io/docs/configure) non-default values for configuration if necessary.

- [Using](https://quicsec.io/docs/use) QuicSec and benefiting from it for various use cases.


## [Demo Example](https://quicsec.io/docs/example-bookstore): Bookstore Microservice Applications

To illustrate the benefits of QuicSec, the bookstore microservice application has been ported to use QuicSec. 

Following the [example](https://quicsec.io/docs/example-bookstore) will provide a quick walkthrough of how QuicSec works to: 

* Migrate the microservices to http/3 (while maintaining http/1.1 compatibility for legacy transition). 

* Automatically taking care of identity and certificate management workflows

* Security with Identity-based TLS or mTLS policies.

* Observability for the application with automatic logs and metrics.
