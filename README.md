## Porting Applications

The [Porting Guide](PORTING_GUIDE.md) describes how to update your golang app to leverage QuicSec to update your http/1 golang app to support http/3.

Demo applications are provided in the Examples folder, including a Bookstore application example and a Simple-http3-client-and-server example.
